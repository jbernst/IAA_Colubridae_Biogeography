# IAA_Colubridae_Biogeography
Code for investigating biogeography of colubrid snakes in the Indo-Australian Archipelago

A separate README file is included for the entire phylogenomics pipeline, with annotated code for genomic data processing, phylogenetic reconstruction, and divergence dating.
* This file cane be found [here](https://github.com/jbernst/IAA_Colubridae_Biogeography/tree/main/phylogenomic_processing).

Code for generating species distribution models are found [here](https://github.com/jbernst/IAA_Colubridae_Biogeography/tree/main/SSDM).

These scripts will be updated upon publication of the manuscript.
